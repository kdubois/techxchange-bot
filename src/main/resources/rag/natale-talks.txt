Red Hat Trusted Software Supply Chain in Action [3527]

More than 2/3 of application code is inherited from open source dependencies. It’s important to provide verified and attested code with provenance checks in the whole software development life cycle. Join this session where developers can learn and understand how to use software bill of materials (SBOM) and Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) as part of the software supply chain for cloud-native applications. Sign commits, images, and pipelines to create a chain of trust for your open source components and transitive dependencies.

The internal developer platform and golden paths: Scaffolding for cloud-native development [3525]

In recent years, modern application development has extended far beyond developers merely dealing with the source code of an application. Many complex aspects and critical tasks related to the build, test, and deployment cycles have progressively shifted toward development teams. However, larger organizations often suffer noticeable productivity losses and frequently face the challenge of regaining control over the resulting 'wild growth’. In this session, Natale Vinto explains the advantages of implementing an internal developer platform (IDP) and how developer teams can benefit from consuming 'golden paths' for their daily work. The IDP is built by a platform team to enable developer self-service and ultimately promote a great developer experience. It consists of many different technologies and tools, integrated in a way that reduces the cognitive load on developers without abstracting away context and underlying technologies.At the end of the session, you'll have a clearer view of how 'golden paths' provide a robust foundation for cloud-native development with out-of-the-box support for immediate guidance to components, resources, and relevant documentation. Your team can swiftly deploy the right tools and components to start work promptly, and we'll showcase real-world use cases where 'golden paths' are put into action.
